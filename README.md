## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and technologies used

- `Use React Native with Expo`: Expo makes it easier to configure the environment;
- `Use the jest library`: Library recommended by React Native;
- `Create unit tests`: Using the jest library to create tests for a function;
- `Generate coverage percentage`: Configure jest to generate the percentage of tested code;
- `Create tests with mocks`: Using jest to simulate behaviors;
- `Use the @testing-library/react-native` library: Robust library for rendering and testing components in memory;
- `Create component tests rendered in memory`: Filling in fields, pressing buttons and more;
- `Use the @testing-library/react-hooks` library: Library that allows easy hook testing;
- `Create hook tests`: Testing the execution of hooks without the need for mocks of native hooks.
